# Comparative Analysis of different Convolutional Neural Network Algorithm for Image Classification

In this study, we conduct a comprehensive analysis of five popular Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) models: LeNet, AlexNet, VGGNet16, ResNet50, and GoogLeNet. These models are evaluated for their performance in image detection and identification using the CIFAR-10 and CIFAR-100 datasets. Our research aims to simplify the understanding and application of different CNNs. We provide detailed insights into each model's accuracy and prediction capabilities. Results indicate that models with more layers, like GoogLeNet and ResNet50, achieve higher accuracy, while simpler models like LeNet and AlexNet struggle with complex classifications. The study emphasizes the importance of high-quality, large datasets and substantial computational resources for training these networks effectively.
